# Excel Sales Analytics Dashboard

Hi! This is a project I built to showcase my ability to analyze and visualize sales data using Excel. It's a fully interactive dashboard designed for business users to get clear, actionable insights from complex datasets â€” **with no need for coding or external tools**.

---

## Project Summary

This Excel dashboard helps track **product sales**, **regional performance**, and **individual salesperson performance** over time. It's built with user-friendly navigation, interactive filters, and dynamic visuals â€” just like a real-world business intelligence tool.

ðŸ”§ Built entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, using:
- Pivot tables
- Slicers
- Charts (bar, line, column)
- Custom formatting for KPIs

##  Dashboard Tabs Overview

### 1. Dashboard Tab
This is the main summary view. It includes:
- **Total Sales Amount** and **Number of Transactions**
- **Sales by Month** (trend line)
- **Sales by Region** (bar chart)
- **Sales Distribution by Product Type**

âž¡ Use the slicers (top) to filter by:
- Date Range
- Product Type
- Region

---

### 2.  Products Tab
This tab breaks down sales by product category.

- Bar charts show **sales volume** of each item
- Highlights **Top-Selling Products**
- Identifies **Underperforming Products**

This section helps with product-level insights â€” like what to promote more or phase out.

---

### 3.Salesman Tab
Focused on individual performance.

- Shows **sales volume per salesperson**
-  Ranks **Top 3 Performers**
- âš Flags the **Bottom 3 Performers**

This is useful for performance reviews, incentives, or training needs.
